          <h2>WHO WE ARE</h2>
          <p>
            Our pseudo-company has specialized in peddling CS:GO skins to
            clueless gamers since the advent of this goldmine of a market in
            2013, and we are experts at it by now. If you feel an overwhelming
            need to impress your peers with vain accessories, we have you
            covered from top to toe. While we couldn’t care less what kind of
            graffiti is all the rage on your guns, we sure do like to make money
            – and so, enter our Flay Market. Here you will find the very same
            overpriced skins you can easily get from almost literally anywhere
            else on the Web. Oh, and pray we never forget: they don’t actually
            do anything. They’re just cosmetics.
          </p>

          <h2>WHAT SKINS ARE</h2>
          <p>
            Basically all you need to know about skins is that you need them to
            be good at the game, even though they add zero advantage to your
            gameplay. Your enemies, your team members, and probably even your
            parents will laugh until they can laugh no more if they ever see you
            one-deag someone without the Kumicho Dragon finish showcased on the
            handle.
          </p>

          <h2>WHAT´S NEXT</h2>
          <p>
            Follow your heart, and follow this link to our Market Area – join
            the rest of the herd in style, mack out with the latest skin fashion
            and never look back. You’ll feel like a million dollars rocking the
            Dragon Lore AWP, and no one can ever tell you otherwise, least of
            all your common sense.
